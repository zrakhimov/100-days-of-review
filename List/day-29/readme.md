## Variables

* After reviewing the main data types in C# let's see how we can use them. In order to work with data we should use **variables.**. We have already seen their usage in the examples, but now let's look at them in more detail.

* A **variable** is a **container of information**, which can change its value. It provides means for:

- Storing information;
- Retrieving the stored information (get);
- Modifying the stored information(set);
