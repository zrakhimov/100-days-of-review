## Variables

* After reviewing the main data types in C# let's see how we can use them. In order to work with data we should use **variables.**. We have already seen their usage in the examples, but now let's look at them in more detail.

* A **variable** is a **container of information**, which can change its value. It provides means for:

- Storing information;
- Retrieving the stored information (get);
- Modifying the stored information(set);

### Characteristics

Variables are characterized by:
- **name** (identifier), for example **age**
- **type** (of information preserved in them), for example **int**
- **value** (stored information), for exampe **25**


* Variable is a named area of memory, which stores a value from a particular data type.
    * Variables can be stored directly in the operational mmemory of the program (stack) or in the dynamic memory (heap) in which larger objects are stored ( such as character strings and arrays)

* **Primitive data types**:
    * numbers, char, bool
    * store their value in the program stack
* **Reference data types**:
    * strings, objects, arrays
    * store an address where the value is stored (heap / dynamic memory)
