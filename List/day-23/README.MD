### Getting Started

- Official Link: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
- "Create React App" is a tool to setup single-page React projects

- Running any of these commands will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder. Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

- Withe create-react-app we get default tools and dependencies chosen for us, for example, a bundler which is webpack.

### Profile Project

- We'll be building a project where there will be a list of profiles which comes from an api, and we will render it using react

- So the first thing is to get setup, run `create-react-app` and open it with VS Code

```terminal
npx create-react-app profiles
cd profiles
npm start
```

- Let's get rid of the boilerplate in `App.js`
