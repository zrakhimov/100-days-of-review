### JavaScript for React

- There are aspects of JavaScript that React **requires** you to know
- React leans on existing parts of JavaScript where possible instead of inventing new ways of to do things.
- It has a new syntax (JSX for example), but uses a ton of existing JavaScript syntax compared to other frameworks where they fill in gaps by introducing a lot of new syntax, API and frameworks.
- Originally React used JavaScript classes 
- So let's go over some of the JavaScript syntax that React uses a lot, so hopefully by keeping this in mind, it'll be easier to understand the code in React.
